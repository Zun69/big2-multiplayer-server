            <h3>Playable Combinations</h3>
            <p>There are four types of legal play: single cards, pairs, triples and five card groups.</p>
            
            <h4>Single cards</h4>
            <p>These rank from two (high) down to three (low), and between cards of the same rank a higher suit beats a lower suit.</p>
            <h4>Pairs</h4>
            <p>A pair of equal ranked cards twos are highest and threes are lowest. Any higher ranked pair beats one with lower ranks. Between equal ranked pairs, the one containing the highest suit is better - for example ♠9-♦9 beats ♥9-♣9 because the ♠ is higher than the ♥, but ♣Q-♦Q beats ♠J-♥J because queens beat jacks.</p>
            <h4>Triples</h4>
            <p>Three equal ranked cards - three twos are highest, then aces, kings, etc. down to three threes, which is the lowest triple.</p>
            <h4>Five card groups</h4>
            <p>There five types of playable five-card combination. In ascending order they are: straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush.</p>
            <p>A <b>Straight</b> consists of five cards of consecutive rank with mixed suits. A straight with higher ranks beats a lower one, irrespective of the suits of the cards. When the ranks are the same, the suit of the top card determines which is higher. So for example ♦K-♣Q-♣J-♥10-♥9 beats ♠Q-♦J-♦10-♦9-♦8, which beats ♦Q-♠J-♠10-♠9-♠8. Twos rank highest in straights, so the highest straight is 2-A-K-Q-J. Aces can be counted as low to make the lowest type of straight 5-4-3-2-A, which is beaten by 6-5-4-3-2 and 7-6-5-4-3. An ace can be used at either end of a straight, but not in the middle, so collections like 3-2-A-K-Q or 2-A-K-Q-J are not valid straights (but there are variations on this rule).</p>
            <p>A <b>Flush</b> consists of any five cards of the same suit. A flush in a higher suit beats a flush in a lower suit, irrespective of the ranks of the cards. Between two flushes in the same suit, the one with the higher top card is better. So for example ♥9-♥7-♥6-♥5-♥3 beats ♣2-♣J-♣9-♣6-♣4, which beats ♣A-♣K-♣Q-♣10-♣7.</p>
            <p>A <b>Full House</b> consists of three cards of one rank and two of another rank; between two full houses, the one whose triple is of higher rank is better - so for example 9-9-9-4-4 beats 8-8-8-K-K.</p>
            <p><b>Four of a kind (or quads)</b> are made up of all four cards of one rank, plus any fifth card. The fifth card must be included - four equal cards by themselves are not a playable combination. Between two fours of a kind, the rank of the four cards determines which is higher.
            <p>A <b>Straight Flush</b> consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit, twos ranking below threes and aces ranking high or low, as in straights. The rank of the highest card determines which of two straight flushes is higher; between two equal ranked straight flushes, the one in the higher suit is better, so the Royal Flush in ♠2 ♠A-♠K-♠Q-♠J-♠10 is the highest straight flush and the best five-card combination, but there are variations on this rule.</p>
            <p>A combination can only be beaten by a better combination with the same number of cards: so a single card can only be beaten by a single card, a pair by a better pair and a triple by a better triple. You cannot for example use a triple to beat a pair or a straight to beat a triple. However, a five card group can be beaten by a five card group of a stronger type - any flush beats any straight, any full house beats any straight or flush, any four of a kind plus an odd card beats any straight, flush or full house and any straight flush beats all of the other type of five card group.</p>
